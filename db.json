The club holds an impressive record, including 20 English top-flight league titles, 12 FA Cups, and 3 UEFA Champions League trophies. Legendary managers such as Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson played pivotal roles in shaping its legacy. Ferguson, in particular, led the team to immense success from 1986 to 2013, including the iconic 1999 treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. Manchester United is celebrated for its resilience, especially following the Munich air disaster in 1958, which claimed the lives of several players. The club overcame this tragedy and became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968. With intense rivalries against Liverpool, Manchester City, and others, United has cultivated one of the largest and most passionate fanbases globally.
